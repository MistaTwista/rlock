# rlock
Clone of [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/), a simple X display locker (by suckless), written in rust.

## Features
+ Keyboard-only lock command line option: Locks keyboard while still displaying monitor

+ Custom password: Unlike slock, which uses the user's system password to exit the lock, rlock allows to set a custom password stored locally, with command line option to modify.
